## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I enhanced my knowledge in backgrounding, especially in linear backgrounding, also in setting flex and grid layouts.

```css

.blue {
    background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(84,158,242,1) 1.6%, rgba(255,255,255,1) 1.6%);
}
```

### Continued development

It is time using javascript in projects.


### Useful resources
